        work in the health care, education and nonprofit sectors. She works collaboratively to facilitate
        growth in individuals effected by cultural trauma, those newly diagnosed adult ADHD at 30, 40,

        <p class="pr-pol-p">Distance counseling has become the norm for many, if not most, client - therapist
            relationships. To engage in telehealth with Dr. Walker a stable internet connection,
            email, and a credit/debit card are needed to participate. You must also have your
            camera on and in a stable location (not driving or in any moving vehicle) throughout the entirety of each session. It is also strongly recommended that you utilize a computer,
            laptop or tablet as opposed to phone. Finally, it is your responsibility to ensure, on your
            end, that you are in a location where your session cannot be overheard by others. If you
            must be in a semi-shared location, headphones are required to increase privacy and to
            decrease background noise
            </p>
            <p>Before our first meeting, I will provide instructions for connecting to a secure, HIPAAcompliant telehealth platform.

            <p class="pr-pol-p">I will keep confidential anything you say as part of our counseling relationship, with the
                following exceptions: </p>
               <ul>
                <li class="pr-list">You direct Dr. Walker in writing to disclose information to someone else.</li>
                <li class="pr-list">Dr. Walker is ordered by a court to disclose information.</li>
                <li class="pr-list">Abuse of Children or Elderly Persons: If a mental health professional reasonably
                    believes that a child under the age of 18 or an elderly person is being abused or
                    neglected, they are legally obligated to report this situation to the appropriate state
                    agency.
                    </li>
                <li class="pr-list">Imminent Harm to Self: If a mental health professional reasonably believes that you
                    are in imminent danger of physically harming and if you are unwilling or unable to
                    follow treatment recommendations, they may have to make an involuntary referral to a
                    hospital and/or contact a family member or other person who may be able to help
                    protect you.</li>
                <li class="pr-list">Imminent Harm to Others: If a mental health professional reasonably believes that you
                    are an actual threat to the safety of another person, they may be required to take some
                    action (such as contacting the police, notifying the other person, seeking involuntary
                    hospitalization, or some combination of these actions.</li>
               </ul> 
                <p>In those rare instances where it is necessary for Dr. Walker to disclose information
                    relating to your counseling without your permission, Dr. Walker will make every effort to
                    fully discuss it with you. However, when Dr. Walker is required to disclose your records
                    pursuant to a court order issued under the Patriot Act, I may be prohibited by the terms
                    of the order from notifying you of the disclosure. </p>
                <p>There are two other instances where Dr. Walker, the therapist, may also be released from
                    the confidentiality rule. One is if there is a charge brought against me to the licensing
                    board or in court, I am allowed to use all information to defend themselves. The second
                    is if a patient does not pay the bill for therapy, after reasonable efforts at collections Dr.
                    Walker is allowed to involve legitimate collections activity by other parties, which will
                    release information such as dates of service, charges, payments and balances necessary
                    for the collections process. </p>

                <p class="pr-pol-p">The relationship you and Dr. Walker share is a professional one, and should not be
                    confused with a friendship or one of a social nature. It is against any mental health
                    therapist's ethical code to participate in a client's life beyond the professional role
                    before, during, or after the client receives services. In order to protect your privacy as
                    well as that of Dr. Walker, please understand that they cannot accept invitations to social
                    gatherings or social media.
                    </p>
                    <p>Together, let's discuss a plan for how we will handle accidental run-ins in public. My
                        general rule of thumb is to take your lead in public, and never make first contact in
                        order to respect your privacy. Also, due to ethical guidelines and respect of our working
                        relationship, please understand that Dr. Walker is unable to accept gifts of any kind.</p>

                within a 24-hour period of your contact, with the exception of weekends and holidays or when she has
                indicated to being away from the office for extended periods of time.</p>

            <p>My fee for a 50 minute session is $175 each session. No refunds are given if sessions are
                terminated by the client (either by no-show or discussed termination) prior to the use of
                pre-paid sessions. Dr. Walker accepts PayPal (paypal.me/quiltedrosecs), HSAs, and all
                major debit and credit cards directly through the SimplePractice portal.
                Dr. Walker does raise fees periodically. When there is any change in fees schedule, they
                will notify you in advance.

            <p class="pr-pol-p">Dr. Walker is in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield of MI and Blue Care Network.</p>

            <p class="pr-pol-p">You are encouraged to call the number on the back of your insurance card to ask about
                your “out-of-network” benefits, so there aren't any financial surprises. Dr. Walker may
                provide you with a receipt at the end of each session which you can submit to your
                insurance company for possible reimbursement. You are responsible for any fees at the
                time of our appointment, and, depending on your plan, a certain percentage may be
                paid to you by your insurance company.</p>
            <p class="pr-pol-p">Upon initiation of the therapeutic relationship Dr. Walker's billing company (Premier
                Billing) may contact you to verify your behavioral health benefits.</p>

            <h3 class="pr-pol-txt2 spa-t ">Cancellation Policy:</h3>
                
            <p class="pr-pol-p">If you are unable to keep an appointment, please contact (text, email or portal message) Dr. Walker within 24 hours to cancel or
                reschedule. You will be charged the full fee of $175 for missed appointments unless you
                cancel or reschedule 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment. Dr. Walker accepts
                PayPal (paypal.me/quiltedrosecs), HSAs, and all major debit and credit cards directly through the SimplePractice portal. Dr. Walker will provide a receipt for all fees paid. A
                fee of $35.00 will be charged for all insufficient funds transfers.
                Finally, after 2 missed sessions (or if the intake session is missed) you will be removed
                from Dr. Walker's list of current (active) clients (i.e. you will be discharged from services
                with Quilted Rose Clinical Services, PLLC). You will receive a final bill for any unpaid
                services as well as referral options.</p>

            <p class="pr-pol-p">Services will be rendered in a professional manner consistent with ethical standards. It is
                impossible to guarantee any specific results regarding your counseling goals as the
                outcome is dependent on the largely unpredictable nature of behavioral health care.
                However, together we will work to achieve the best possible results. Referral to another
                counselor or service will be mutually discussed if progress is not achieved at a
                satisfactory level or in the event that additional services may be in your best interest.</p>
